# How to generate and send e-mails (bulk mail) while iterating through datasource records


<p>In some scenarios, you need to generate e-mail letters and send them while iterating through some datasource records.</p><p>Let's consider the following scenario. We have a master-detail database. A master table contains information about customers whom we need to send letters. A detail table contains information to generate letters.</p><br />
<p>To generate and send letters, we need to perform the following actions while iterating through the data source:</p><p>1. Create a filtered view from the child table based on the customer's ID.</p><p>2. Use this view as a SnapControl's mail merge data source.</p><p>3. Iterate through this view records.</p><p>4. Perform the mail-merge operation.</p><p>5. Generate an e-mail letter based on the SnapControl's document as demonstrated in the following example: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4438">How to export the RichEditControl document into an Outlook mail item</a><u></u></p><p><u></u>You may notice only one issue. The content of some letters will be generated incorrectly.</p><p>This occurs since the loading of the mail template into the SnapControl is executed asynchronously and can require more time than iterating to the next datasource record.</p><p>When a document is completely loaded into the SnapControl (or RichEditControl), the DocumentLoaded event is raised.</p><br />
<p>To avoid the issue with an incorrectly generated content of a letter, you need to send letters in the DocumentLoaded event handler.</p><p>We recommend saving generated letters in a temporary folder while iterating through datasource records.</p><p>After all letters are saved, load these files and send the letters synchronously in the SnapControl.DocumentLoaded event handler.</p><p>This example demonstrates this approach in action.</p>
